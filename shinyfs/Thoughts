History:
    Each file stores its history, indexed by timestamp





Tree-based overlay network:
    A self-organizing hierarchical overlay network.  Network structure mirrors filesystem structure,
    with nodes assuming responsibility for files that are within directories they are responsible for

    The root node is the master of all, however (almost) all work he is responsible for is recursively
    passed down to subnodes

    This overlay network is responsible for the following:
        1) Adding a node into the network (This includes partitioning the filesystem for each node)
        2) Recovering when a node ragequits
        3) Performing a node lookup for an associated inode
        4) Adding/removing inodes from the tree
        5) Choosing/recognizing a root node
        6) Propogating messages from an arbitrary node throughout the network
        7) Authenticating and verifying identity on all messages

    This overlay network is constructed under the following assumptions:
        1) The network is too large for every node to be connected to, or even aware of, every other
        2) All nodes participating in the network are reachable by all others

    
    Protocol specification:
        PARTITIONING:
            Each inode has a weight.  In the case of a file, (right now) it is identically 1.
            Dirs are the sum of all files underneath them, adding nothing themselves. Note that
            files are only counted once; under their primary directory.
  
            The root node performs a tree traversal, calculating weights for all dirs, and then
            begins partitioning; The root node sorts the top-level directory by increasing weight,
            and starts assigning files/dirs to nodes beginning with itself, summing up until the
            amount of weight summed together divided by the ideal weight per node is greater than 1.
            If the root is assigned to another dir during this process, it repeats this process
            for each subdirectory it is assigned to. It MUST account for the weight it is already
            responsible for when performing the recursive assignment, however.  The same goes for
            nodes that are assigned to multiple files and dirs by the root node, when they begin their
            recursive process. If a directory has directories that have large amounts of weight, then
            a "sub-root" node must be chosen (by the root node, randomly) to partition the inodes it
        has under its control.  Therefore, this process is recursive, should weight the tree
            somewhat fairly, so that the average number of files owned by a single node is the total
            weight of the tree divided by the number of nodes in the network.

            Note that at this instant the root node must be aware of all nodes in the network, whereas
            the sub-roots must be aware only of their parent, and the 
        NODE ADDITION:
            [A] somehow finds the overlay network, and asks the root node [/] for a position in the
            network.  The root node takes pity, and after verifying that [A] is reachable through
            NAT/firewalls, assigns [A] to the subroot with the highest [weight]/[#sub nodes] ratio.
            The subroot then inspects the current state of its subtree, and if the weight/node
            ratio of any subtree is greater than the current directory, it is passed off to that
            directory, otherwise the current directory is repartitioned.

            Once any subtree increases beyond 2 times the ideal threshold of [weight]/[#all nodes]
            or falls below 1/2 times, the root node triggers a complete repartitioning of the tree.
        NODE REMOVAL:
            If any subroot finds that one of their nodes is gone, they merely trigger a localized
            repartitioning of their subtree.  Note that in order to do this, all roots must be
            aware of TWO levels below them.  That is, all of their children, and their grandchildren,
            as if one of their children ragequits, they must be able to communicate with the orphans

            If the root node ragequits, the network chooses another root node per the instructions
            in [CHOOSING A ROOT NODE] and repartitions.
        NODE LOOKUP:
            If node [A] is looking for inode 10356, it knows that the parent directory for that
            inode is [/media/music], therefore if [A] is in [/media/video/BSG], it will ask
            [/media/video] for [/media], and it will then ask [/media/music] for access to 10356.
            
            If [A] is NAT'ed or Firewalled or just explicitly not participating in the overlay
            network, it will merely contact the root node.
        CHOOSING A ROOT NODE:
            A root node is either set by the network operator, or chosen randomly from the set
            of greedy nodes, or chosen randomly from the set of all other nodes.
        MESSAGE PROPAGATION
            If node [A] has just closed a write lock the opened on [/media/music], the latter
            must report the change to all other nodes.  [/media/music] will notify all children
            as well as its parent, and all children will notify their children (and not their
            parents) and all parent will notify their parents and all other children.
        AUTHENTICATION
            All nodes must trust all other nodes completely once they are in the network. Gaining
            access to the network is currently not authenticated, see future work


Authentication and Encryption:
    All users have their own RSA keys.  Authentication into the network by a node is
    done with this key, after which symmetric encryption is setup between each set of nodes.
    
    These keys are stored into the [ShinyPeer] class, as each peer pair should have its own
    random key.  All operations between nodes are therefore handled by the encryption, as the
    symmetric keys they use are proof enough that the other peer is the user they say they are.




    Future work:
        - directory weights calculated when partitioning should include usage statistics
        - choose root nodes based on some kind of metric, such as latency
        - use assymetric encryption to authenticate new nodes, and do not let them
            join the network unless a network operator adds the key, or another node
            already in the network "vouches" for it by signing the newcomer's key
            with their own key.
